They then emotionally manipulate the victim into refunding the extra money — often before the victim realizes no such money was received. These scams rely on urgency, emotional pressure, and impersonation.\n\nAlways verify the caller’s identity, never rush into refunding money, and double-check bank statements. When in doubt, ask for transaction proof or call the actual person being impersonated. Report immediately if you suspect fraud.",

They may ask you to pay a 'registration fee', 'interview fee', or 'security deposit'.\n\nAlways verify job offers through official company websites or trusted job portals. No genuine company asks for money to offer a job. Check for grammar errors, suspicious emails, and urgent messages. If scammed, keep all payment receipts, emails, and chat history to file a complaint.",

Once you share your documents (Aadhaar, PAN, bank details), scammers either disappear after collecting 'processing fees', or offer loans with hidden, extreme interest rates and later harass for repayment.\n\nAvoid downloading unknown loan apps from unofficial sources.

These cases often begin with fake romantic profiles on social media or dating apps. Once trust is built, they trick victims into sharing private content, and then begin threatening them. \n\nNever share explicit content online, even in private chats.

Scammers often approach via WhatsApp, Telegram, or SMS, posing as SEBI-registered analysts or insiders. Victims are added to premium groups and shown fake profits using screenshots or trading dashboards. \n\nBe cautious of unsolicited tips or calls promising quick profits.
